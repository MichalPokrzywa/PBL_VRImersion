KAT Universal SDK V 1.9.2

[Welcome]
Welcome to the KAT Universal SDK for Unity. With this SDK, you can develop with all KAT devices without additional adaptation work. All devices adhere to the same interface, named the KATNativeSDK class. For the simplest usage, simply drag the [KATDemoWalker] prefab into your scene and enable OpenXR support in Unity. For advanced development, the comments in KATNativeSDK.cs provide comprehensive details on all SDK features.
